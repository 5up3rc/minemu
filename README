NOTES:

- Minemu requires a CPU with support for SSE 4.1 instructions
  (45nm intel Core 2 Duo, and up.)

- The file /etc/ld.so.nohwcap must be present to make user
  programs avoid vector instructions (there is no CPUID emulation yet.)

- the kernel must always allow memory overcommitting (instead of
  depending on heuristics.) This can be achieved by setting the sysctl:

    vm.overcommit_memory=1
